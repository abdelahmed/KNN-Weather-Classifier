# KNN-Weather-Classifier

The accuracy of weather forecasts is important for protecting life and property, and for making informed decisions about business and farming activities. This model aims to classify weather conditions in Seattle based on data such as precipitation, temperature, and wind speed. The data set used for this analysis contains daily observations of weather in Seattle from 2012 to 2015, including variables such as date, precipitation, maximum and minimum temperature, wind speed, and weather type (such as drizzle, rain, sun, snow, and fog). By understanding the relationships between these variables, meteorologists can make better predictions about the weather for the public. The k-nearest neighbors algorithm is used in this analysis because the weather type variable is categorical. The advantages and disadvantages of using this algorithm will be discussed in the discussion section.
