# Weather Forecast Model - Seattle
The accuracy of weather forecasts is critical for safeguarding life and property and making informed decisions about business and farming activities. The objective of this model is to classify weather conditions in Seattle by analyzing data such as precipitation, temperature, and wind speed.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis contains daily observations of weather in Seattle from 2012 to 2015, including variables such as date, precipitation, maximum and minimum temperature, wind speed, and weather type (such as drizzle, rain, sun, snow, and fog).

## Objective
By understanding the relationships between these variables, meteorologists can make better predictions about the weather for the public. The k-nearest neighbors algorithm is used in this analysis because the weather type variable is categorical.

## Methodology
The K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm is a simple, yet powerful machine learning technique. It is used to solve classification problems where the data points are separated into several classes. The idea behind the KNN algorithm is to find the nearest neighbors of a data point and assign it the class of the majority of its neighbors.

## Advantages
The KNN algorithm is simple and easy to implement. It is a non-parametric algorithm, which means that it does not make any assumptions about the underlying data distribution. It is also highly flexible since the choice of the value of k can be changed according to the requirements of the model.

## Disadvantages
One of the major disadvantages of the KNN algorithm is that it is computationally expensive, especially when dealing with large datasets. Another limitation of the KNN algorithm is that it is sensitive to the choice of distance metric used to measure the distance between the data points.

## Conclusion
The accuracy of weather forecasts is essential for the public, and this model aims to improve the quality of weather predictions in Seattle. By utilizing the KNN algorithm, the weather type variable can be accurately predicted based on other variables such as precipitation, temperature, and wind speed.
